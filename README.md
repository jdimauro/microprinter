Setting Up the Sinatra App
--------------------------

For the sinatra app, you will need:

The [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) gem. `#=> gem install sinatra`
The [Sinatra Config File](https://github.com/rkh/sinatra-config-file) gem. `#=> gem install sinatra-config-file`

There's very little in the way of documentation, and the code is currently a hash of notes to self, ideas, and doodles.  

Working on that.  

Really. 


Elsewhere: 
---------
  Ben O'Steen has a [Python port of the library][pymicro].

TODO
----

In no particular order, some things to be done:

-   add code to manage `/print?url=http://url.com`  
-   check RSS feeds and print new items as they appear  
    Examples: twitter, latest links on pinboard.in, latest instapaper itemsâ€¦
-   make URL for weather reports configurable so it's not hard coded to south of england (!)
-   create a config file for arduino port, RSS feeds, weather location
-   re-integrate debug library into microprinter.rb - pipe serial messages to console for debugging and automated testing. 
-   format the RSS feed item printout to shorten the URL and print properly so that it can be OCR'd with Google Goggles
-   possibly port Ben O'Steen's image stuff so that you can print QRCodes on links, as well as images. 
-   barcodes, 1D (built-in capability)
-   make `/` do something useful, like display a form that you can feed printable items into.

### Also, I want a pony

Some todo items that may or may not end up being useful, feasible, interesting, or just plain dumb.

-   add some kind of polling behavior for specified feeds
-   integrate tom taylor's microprinter-over-ethernet-shield setup, so you can use this sinatra app with one or the other? 
-   bookmarklet for printing locally
